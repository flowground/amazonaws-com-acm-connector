For more information, see the documentation for each\nservice. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see \nImporting Certificates\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html] in the \nAWS Certificate Manager User Guide. \n\nACM does not provide managed renewal\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html] for\ncertificates that you import.\n\nNote the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:\n\n *  You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are\n   importing.\n   \n   \n *  The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is\n   protected by a password or a passphrase.\n   \n   \n *  If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its\n   certificate chain.\n   \n   \n *  If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of\n   the certificates in the chain.\n   \n   \n *  The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.\n   \n   \n *  The current time must be between the Not Before and Not After certificate\n   fields.\n   \n   \n *  The Issuer field must not be empty.\n   \n   \n *  The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.\n   \n   \n *  To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn argument. Include this\n   argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.\n   \n   \n *  When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the\n   certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names\n   preceded by file://. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the \n   C:\\temp folder as file://C:\\temp\\certificate_to_import.pem. If you are making\n   an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs. \n   \n   \n *  When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the\n   certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner\n   required by the programming language you're using. \n   \n   \n\nThis operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html] of\nthe imported certificate.",
